                <p><img id="pImg" src="assets/images/6W7Y0252copy.jpg" alt=""> &nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I've moved with my wife here to California where both she and I could pursue further education in fields that we're passionate about. With primary experience in Front End Web Development, I had chosen to broaden my horizon by taking the UC Berkeley Extension Coding Boot Camp.

                (Bob Ross lipsum) You need to have a very firm paint to do this. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. In your world you have total and absolute power. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. It's all a game of angles. You need the dark in order to show the light. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. Let all these things just sort of happen.
